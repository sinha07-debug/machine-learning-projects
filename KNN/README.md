# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) from Scratch

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scratch using only NumPy.

KNN is a simple, non-parametric, supervised learning algorithm used for:

- Classification
- Regression

---

# Core Idea

KNN works on the principle:

> "Data points that are close to each other are likely to have the same label."

---

# Steps

1. Compute distance from test point to all training points  
2. Select K nearest neighbors  
3. Perform majority voting (classification)

---

# Distance Metric

We use Euclidean Distance:

:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

---

# Algorithm Steps

1. Store training data  
2. For each test point:
   - Compute distances to all training points
   - Sort distances
   - Select top K neighbors
   - Perform majority vote

---

# Features of This Implementation

- No external ML libraries (no sklearn)
- Fully implemented using NumPy
- Synthetic dataset generated programmatically
- Visualization using matplotlib
- Decision boundary plotting
- Accuracy evaluation using leave-one-out validation

---

# Choosing K

- Small K → Overfitting (high variance)
- Large K → Underfitting (high bias)

---

# Limitations

- Slow for large datasets (`O(n)` per prediction)
- Sensitive to feature scaling
- Performance degrades in high dimensions
